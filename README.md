# AdventOfCode-2022
Learning a new language with AoC2022 - Rust!

Using VS code with Rust extension (duh!).

## Day 1

Took a lot more time than anticipated ðŸ˜’. File reading is a bit too convoluted and unclear. Optionals everywhere. Also having to use `mut` on most variables seems wrong somehow... Overall first impression - not great! I'm up to a <i>fun</i> month ðŸ˜….

## Day 2

Relatively easy. Not the most optimal solution in terms of lines of code, but it works. Used `.expect()` to handle optionals (`Result` in Rust language) and tried using `match` expressions instead of `if`. They are quite nice. So far so good. Getting a lot of compiler warnings for unused functions from day 1 though, might get annoying...

## Day 3

Used a set for part 1 (could have also used an array I guess). For part 2 I had to convert the Lines iterator to `peekable` to be able to use `peek` method, which does not consume the iterator (move it forward). The new "peekable iterator" also has to be mutable (`mut`) for some reason. Overall relatively smooth sailing so far ðŸ˜Ž.

## Day 4

Easy, no problems. Used `split()` and `collect()` for input parsing in addition to `expect()`, although I could have also used `unwrap()`, but it's not recommended (according to VS Code Rust plugin). A strange pattern I'm noticing is that part 2 is usually a bit easier than part 1. Or am I doing something wrong?
