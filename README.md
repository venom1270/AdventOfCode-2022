# AdventOfCode-2022
Learning a new language with AoC2022 - Rust!

Using VS code with Rust extension (duh!).

## Day 1

Took a lot more time than anticipated ðŸ˜’. File reading is a bit too convoluted and unclear. Optionals everywhere. Also having to use `mut` on most variables seems wrong somehow... Overall first impression - not great! I'm up to a <i>fun</i> month ðŸ˜….

## Day 2

Relatively easy. Not the most optimal solution in terms of lines of code, but it works. Used `.expect()` to handle optionals (`Result` in Rust language) and tried using `match` expressions instead of `if`. They are quite nice. So far so good. Getting a lot of compiler warnings for unused functions from day 1 though, might get annoying...
